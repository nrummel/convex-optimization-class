# Syllabus for APPM 5630 Advanced Convex Optimization

Spring 2023, Instructor: Stephen Becker

Since there is no established optimization curriculum at CU Boulder, we will attempt to cover a lot of material in just one semester. We can divide topics into four broad categories:

- **Analysis**: Basic theory (convex analysis, optimality, duality)
- **Methods**: Standard methods, both classical and modern, and standard classifications. The idea is to give students a toolkit of standard approaches to solve actual problems.
- **Convergence**: Convergence theory (ellipsoid, Nesterov, etc.). This involves some very beautiful mathematics (and is also useful!)
- **Applications**: Often in signal processing and machine learning

The course investigates landmark convex optimization algorithms and their complexity results. We aim to cover both key theory, such as polynomial time algorithms for linear programming and the optimality of Nesterov’s method, while also surveying current practical state-of-the-art methods.

### Official course description
Investigates landmark convex optimization algorithms and their complexity results. Studies both theory while also surveying current practical state-of-the-art methods. Topics may include Fenchel-Rockafellar duality, KKT conditions, proximal methods, and Nesterov acceleration.


### Related courses at CU
This course is similar to the CS department's [CSCI 5254](http://spot.colorado.edu/~lich1539/cvxopt.html) but goes a bit farther.

Here's a list of [optimization classes taught at CU](https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/optimization)



### Principal Topics
convex sets, convex analysis, Fenchel-Legendre conjugates, Fenchel-Rockafellar and Lagrangian duality, KKT and Slater’s conditions, conic optimization, (stochastic) gradient descent, calculating gradients, proximal methods, constrained optimization

### Learning Goals/Outcomes
[//]: # ( Not testable; high-level )
[//]: # ( Learning Objectives, i.e., quantifiable outcomes )
[//]: # ( Something measurable )
Students will learn the mathematics behind convex analysis, and why convexity is useful in optimization problems. Students will understand the setup and optimality of optimization problems, and how math can be used to provide explicit certificates of sub-optimality as well as implicit certificates via worst-case convergence rates. Students will know how to program core methods, applied to a few examples, and learn to construct programs in a modular, debuggable fashion. Students will synthesis their knowledge by producing a final project demonstrating application of optimization to real-world problems

Legend: * means last day to add a class (without instructor approval), ** is last day to drop a class (without a W), *** is last day to withdraw from a class (student receives a W)

HW 1-2 is due early, but I don't want to push the due-date back farther because I want students to get feedback on a homework before they have to decide about withdrawing from the class (Feb 1, lecture #7).

# Resources

We will not follow a single textbook. The following resources (mostly available online) will be the **primary references**:

- [BV2004] S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe, “Convex Optimization” (Cambridge U. Press, 2004). [Free electronic version](http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/)  This is a standard text that gives some convex analysis background and focuses on interior-point methods and engineering applications. The books is very useful, and I recommend you buy a copy. We will follow the book closely at the beginning of the semester. The appendices A and C are also quite useful if you do not have an applied math background.
- [V_course] L. Vandenberghe’s [course notes for ee236b](http://www.seas.ucla.edu/~vandenbe/ee236b/ee236b.html) follow the book, while his course notes for [ee236c](www.seas.ucla.edu/~vandenbe/ee236c.html) contain more details on proofs and advanced topics.
- [NW05] J. Nocedal and S. Wright, “Numerical Optimization” (Springer, 2005). We have free electronic
access at CU via [SpringerLink](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-40065-5). This is the go-to reference for implementing a standard method.
- [Beck17] Amir Beck, “First-Order Methods in Optimization” (SIAM, 2017). A more advanced text than
Beck’s 2014 text; free on campus at [SIAM eBooks](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611974997)
- [BC17]	H. Bauschke and P. Combettes, “Convex Analysis and Monotone Operator Theory in Hilbert Spaces”, 2nd ed, Springer 2017, available electronically via [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-48311-5). A nice collection of results, best as a reference and not as a step-by-step textbook. Sometimes we refer to the 2011 1st edition.

Some supplemental resources:

- Lijun Chen teaches a similar optimization course in the CS department, [CSCI 5254](http://spot.colorado.edu/~lich1539/cvxopt.html). That course uses the Boyd and Vandenberghe book.  See also a [list of optimization courses at CU](https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/optimization)

- [Encyclopedia of Optimization](https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-0-387-74759-0), 2009 Edition edited by C. A. Floudas and P. M. Pardalos is very comprehensive and has many articles on detailed topics. There are many other books that have similar names ("handbook of optimization", etc) but most of those are somewhat random in content (usually compiled after a conference). In contrast, this encylopedia really is what you hope it might be.

- Ben Recht's [CS 726: Nonlinear Optimization I at Wisconsin 2012](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~brecht/cs726.html)
- Sebastian Bubeck's [ORF523: The complexities of optimization](https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/orf523-the-complexities-of-optimization/) at Princeton (blog style) and his [monograph on the same topic, "Convex Optimization: Algorithms and Complexity"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4980) (pdf, published in Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning, Vol. 8: No. 3-4, pp 231-357, 2015); another [link](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/sebubeck/Bubeck15.pdf)
More advanced resources:

- Ben Recht's [Convex Optimization and Approximation: Optimization for Modern Data Analysis EECS 227C/STAT 260
Spring 2016](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/eecs227c.html) and his [CS294 - The Mathematics of Information and Data](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/cs294.html)
- [Arkadi Nemirovski](http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/) has many lecture notes on various topics, including linear programming.
  - His [Lectures on Modern Convex Optimization](http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/Lect_ModConvOpt.pdf) with A. Ben-Tal may be the most relevant; the PDF notes are from 2013, and they have a 2001 [book from SIAM of the same title](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9780898718829)
  - For complexity and linear programming, see his [Introduction to Linear Optimization](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/OPTILectureNotes2016.pdf) from 2016
- John Duchi's [Introductory Lectures on Stochastic Optimization](https://stanford.edu/~jduchi/PCMIConvex/)
- Stephen Boyd’s [course notes for EE364a](http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/), which follow his book.
- Amir Beck, “Introduction to Nonlinear Optimization: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications with MATLAB” (SIAM, 2014, $89). This covers classical results but by a modern researcher aware of current research
- Stephen Wright, “Primal-Dual Interior-Point Methods” (SIAM 1997), available electronically from [SIAM](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611971453). Good summary of LP theory, and more practical/thorough IPM discussion than in [BV2004]
(e.g., includes Mehotra’s predictor-corrector method), though restricted to LP of course.
- R. Tyrrell Rockafellar, “Convex Analysis”, Princeton 1970 (reprinted 1997). Terry Rockafellar wrote the first, and definitive, book on the subject.
- D. Bertsekas, A. Nedic, A.E. Ozdaglar, “Convex Analysis and Optimization” (Athena Scientific).
- D. Bertsekas, “Convex Optimization Theory” (Athena Scientific). [Bertsekas has a lot of other books with useful information as well]
- J. M. Borwein and A. S. Lewis, “[Convex Analysis and Nonlinear Optimization](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-31256-9/page/1)” (Springer). A bit more mathematical
- J.B. Hiriart-Urruty and C. Lemarechal, “Convex Analysis and Minimization Algorithms” (Springer). More on analysis, less on optimization. Technical and a useful reference.
- D. Luenberger and Y. Ye, “[Linear and Nonlinear Programming](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-74503-9)” (Springer). A bit more mathematical than [BV2004], slightly different topics.
- R. Tyrrell Rockafellar and Roger J. B. Wets, "[Variational Analysis](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-02431-3)" (Springer; via SpringerLink or Rockafellar's website), goes more into detail on the analysis portion; a good mathematical reference for researchers.

And a fun miscellaneous reference:

- Harvey Greenberg (UC Denver, emeritus), [Myths and counterexamples in mathematical programming](https://glossary.informs.org/myths/CurrentVersion/myths.pdf). Entertaining and informative




### Programming
Homeworks will involve by mathematical analysis and programming.

Students are expected to already know how to program.  We encourage using **Python** and **Matlab**; **Julia** is another good choice though we will not be using it explicitly.  For homework assignments, usually the deliverable is the outcome of some code, so therefore the student may choose any reasonable programming language. However, we will be doing demonstrations in Python and/or Matlab (and the instructor is best at debugging Python and Matlab).  Most of our demonstrations will be using [github](http://github.com) in conjunction with [python via colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

For Matlab, we'll use [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx) (though [yalmip](https://yalmip.github.io/) is also good); for Python, we'll use [cvxpy](http://cvxpy.org/); for Julia, try [Convex.jl](http://convexjl.readthedocs.io/). These are all good prototyping packages.

Matlab and Python mainly rely on small third-party packages. Julia has more "official"-like packages. Most of them use the [JuMP](https://jump.dev/) framework, including big packages like [JuliaSmoothOptimizers / SolverTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/SolverTools.jl) and [JuliaNLSolvers / Optim.jl](https://julianlsolvers.github.io/Optim.jl/stable/).  One of the nice things about Julia is that it has very good automatic differentiation support (see a [discussion of Julia AD packages](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/state-of-automatic-differentiation-in-julia/43083/3)). Other nice things about Julia: very active and friendly community that are eager to help if you post in the forums; code executes very rapidly (like C and Fortran); high-level programming like Python and Matlab; lots of packages, and increasing quickly (way behind Python overall, but catching up in terms of specialized numerics packages); easy to call Python libraries from within Julia.

We recommend use of an IDE or something like JupyterLab.

We do **not** recommend using C, C++ or Fortran for programming in this class; these languages take a lot longer to prototype in, and the performance can be fast but only if you do it right (and usually requires calling the right kind of libraries, like [NAG](https://www.nag.com/content/nag-library) or GLPK or using suites like PETSc, Trilinos, [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), etc.)

For automatic differentiation in Matlab, try [ADiMat](https://www.sc.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/res/sw/adimat/general/index.en.jsp); in Python, try [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
